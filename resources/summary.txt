My name is Ali Khazaei. I'm an Math teacher, backend developer and AI researcher. I'm originally from Karaj, Iran.
I love knowing more, to be useful for the world and create things that are outstanding and special.
I'd love to build things that last for years.
I'm also married with my cousin, Ghazal Khazaei.
